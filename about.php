<h3 class="center">Welcome to BDWebProduction - Design and Development for Personal and Small Business Websites.</h3>
<p>BDWebProduction started in 2010 as the project of freelance web design and developer Blair Davidson.  As the sole point of accountability for the performance of BDWebProduction I take pride in delivering a quality experience to the client.  From the conceptualisation of your custom design, through the development of the website itself, to personal one on one training, my goal is to deliver a quality product combined with great service throughout the entire process.</p>
<p>After graduating university (specialising in Marketing and Information Science) and a large stint in the snow as a professional snowboard instructor between the Southern Alps of New Zealand and the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, I found myself in Sydney, Australia.  It was here under a web development course with Dynamic Web Training that I decided to further progress my skills working in the WWW. <br/><br/> Through the course and further experience i've been able to specialise in XHTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, utilising Jquery scripts, as well as Photoshop to create anything from a basic informative site, to larger dynamic websites &amp; ecommerce solutions, utilising a database and content management system in the backend. &nbsp;Despite working remotely, I have also had great success delivering client tutorials and instruction on the use of their website and content management system via Skype.<br/>
                        I also focus on graphic design and digital art creation / enhancement for certain projects, and have been known to dabble in video editing. <br/><br/>Although BDWebProduction is based in New Zealand, I currently spend my time between New Zealand and Colorado and am continually looking to take on any projects that are possible via the internet.<br/><br/>  Thank you for your interest.<br/><br/>Best regards, <br/><br/>Blair Davidson
