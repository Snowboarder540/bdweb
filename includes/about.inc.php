			<h3>Welcome to BDWebProduction - the online portfolio of Blair Davidson. </h3> <p>After graduating university (specialising in Marketing and Information Science) and a large stint in the snow as a professional snowboard instructor between the Southern Alps of New Zealand and the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, I found myself in Sydney, Australia.  It was here under a web development course with Dynamic Web Training that I decided to further progress my skills working in the WWW. <br/><br/> Through the course and further experience i've been able to specialise in XHTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, utilising Jquery scripts, as well as Photoshop to create anything from a basic informative site to larger dynamic websites utilising a database and content management system in the backend.  <br/>Despite working remotely, I have had also had great success delivering client tutorials and instruction on the use of their website and content management system.<br/>
                        I also focus on graphic design and digital art creation / enhancement for certain projects as well, and have been known to dable in video editing. <br/><br/>Currently spending my time between New Zealand and Colorado I am continually looking to take on any projects that are possible via the internet.<br/><br/>  Thank you for your interest.<br/><br/>Best regards, <br/><br/>Blair Davidson
