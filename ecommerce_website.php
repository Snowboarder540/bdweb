<h3>Features</h3>
<h4>Custom Design</h4>
<p>We will create a custom design either based on your existing company branding, or work with you to create the desired look and feel for your website.

We will then work with you to create up to 10 pages of content, including a contact page and form, to kickstart your online ecommerce presence.</p>

<h4>Content Management System</h4>
<p>Included with your website will be the award winning Silverstripe Content Management System.  This CMS provides all the day-to-day editing control you're likely to need as a content author. With WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) and drag &amp; drop functions, site editors have full control over the way they want their content to look without needing to know HTML. If you can use a word processor, you can use SilverStripe CMS. Images and files can be added through a drag &amp; drop interface.  SilverStripe CMS lets you plan your content in advance, offering draft and live versions of your site.  As the CMS is installed in the backend of your website, you or your team can access and edit your website content at anytime, from anywhere with an internet connection.
