<h3 class="cleft">Features</h3>
<h4>Custom Design</h4>
<p>We will create a custom design either based on your existing company branding, or work with you to create the desired look and feel for your website.  This will then be incorporated into 3 individual page layouts, for example: A homepage style, contact page style, and generic page style, which are then used throughout your website.  We will then work with you to create up to 5 pages of content including a contact page and form, to kickstart your online presence.</p>

<h4>Content Management System</h4>
<p>Included with your website will be the award winning Silverstripe Content Management System.  This CMS provides all the day-to-day editing control you're likely to need as a content author. With WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) and drag &amp; drop functions, site editors have full control over the way they want their content to look without needing to know HTML. If you can use a word processor, you can use SilverStripe CMS. Images and files can be added through a drag &amp; drop interface.  SilverStripe CMS lets you plan your content in advance, offering draft and live versions of your site.  As the CMS is installed in the backend of your website, you or your team can access and edit your website content at anytime, from anywhere with an internet connection.</p>

<h4>2 Hours of Personal Training</h4>
<p>We include 2 hours of training time, via Skype or in person, to get you or your team up to speed with using your website and managing your content with the Silverstripe CMS.</p>
<p><i>"I have been taking online tutorials with Blair, during the design of my website and learning how to load product images and categories onto my site once it was completed. I was not an accomplished computer user, but Blair made it an easy and pleasant experience through our skpe tutorials. He was very patient and easy to understand and I can now successfuly work all parts of my website." - Brenda Murphy, <a href="www.florabunda.co.nz">Florabunda</a></i></p>
